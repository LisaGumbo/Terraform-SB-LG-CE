# Terraform-SB-LG-CE

**Sequita Bridges**

Original goals and how they changed (if at all)
- To create a full stack App using Terraform
- Only able to create the Infrastructure:

    VPC,
    Subnets(public and private),
    Route Table and Associations,
    EC2 instances for fronted, backend, and MongoDB,
    Security Groups
- We were not able to get any of the scripts to work correctly

What I learned
- can use the echo command to add data to files
- learned Terraform which is an HCL(High-Level Configuration Language)

What I'd do next if given more time
- get the scripts to work

Original goals and how they changed (if at all)
- The original goal was to have a completely automated deployment of infrastructure and applications. 
  We did not have time to complete all the shell scripts for application installation.
  
What I learned
- I learned more about
- Shell scripting
- Terraform
- Infrastructure automation
 
What I'd do next if given more time
- I would want to automate the deployment to Kubernetes. Like what was done for the previous project.

Original goal and how they changed (if at all): 
- My original goal was to create terraform resources and scripts for a full stack application and I still have that goal.

LEARNED: 
- I learned how useful Terraform is and how it cuts down time when provisioning new aws resources. It also improves the 
  process of making changes to existing resources. In addition, it also minimize human errors throughout the process of 
  utilizing aws resources.  I also learned that terrafrom has useful logs that can help with trouble shooting.

MORE TIME: 
- If I had more time, I would definitely practice using terraform a lot more and I would also want to create a single page 
  application with questions that will be connected to terraform( as seen with state farm Karl presention video).
